      <h3><u>Special Cooking Tip</u></h3>
      <p>
        Don‚Äôt <mark>overcook</mark> your seafood! Most seafood cooks very
        quickly ‚Äî <mark></mark>shrimp turn pink in just a couple of minutes,
        scallops get rubbery if left too long, and mussels open as soon as
        they‚Äôre done. To keep everything tender and juicy, add each type of
        seafood to the pan in stages based on their cooking time:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with salmon chunks and scallops (they take a bit longer).</li>
        <li>Add shrimp and calamari next (cook until just opaque).</li>
        <li>Add mussels last and cover the pan to steam until they open.</li>
        <li>
          Finally, fold in the delicate crab meat at the very end, warming it
          gently without cooking too long.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Using this timing approach ensures every seafood element is perfectly
        cooked and keeps your dish fresh, flavorful, and restaurant-quality.
