      <h3><u>Special Cooking Tip</u></h3>
      <p>
        Don‚Äôt <mark>overcook</mark> your seafood! Most seafood cooks very
        quickly ‚Äî <mark></mark>shrimp turn pink in just a couple of minutes,
        scallops get rubbery if left too long, and mussels open as soon as
        they‚Äôre done. To keep everything tender and juicy, add each type of
        seafood to the pan in stages based on their cooking time:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start with salmon chunks and scallops (they take a bit longer).</li>
        <li>Add shrimp and calamari next (cook until just opaque).</li>
        <li>Add mussels last and cover the pan to steam until they open.</li>
        <li>
          Finally, fold in the delicate crab meat at the very end, warming it
          gently without cooking too long.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Using this timing approach ensures every seafood element is perfectly
        cooked and keeps your dish fresh, flavorful, and restaurant-quality.

      <h4><u>Nutrition Facts</u></h4>
      <details>
        <p>
          A balanced diet provides essential nutrients that support overall
          health and well-being. Typically, a healthy meal contains a mix of
          macronutrients including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, along with
          vitamins and minerals. Carbohydrates are the body‚Äôs main energy
          source, ideally making up about 45-65% of daily calories. They include
          sugars, starches, and fiber ‚Äî with fiber aiding digestion and
          promoting a feeling of fullness. Proteins, which contribute 10-35% of
          daily calories, are vital for muscle repair, enzyme function, and
          immune health. Sources include meat, dairy, legumes, and nuts. Fats,
          though calorie-dense, are crucial for brain function, hormone
          production, and absorbing fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).
          Healthy fats such as unsaturated fats found in olive oil, avocados,
          and fish should be favored over saturated and trans fats.
